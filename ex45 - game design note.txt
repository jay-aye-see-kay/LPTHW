'runner' that knows about each room

Need a room class

Each room is a class that returns a result

Main function that creates objects from the right class
each time a room is called

Rooms:
   (0)Hallway:
    starting point, 4 doors:
    kitchen, bedroom, toilet, laundry
  (1)Kitchen:

    Hallway
  (2)Bedroom:

  (3)Toilet:
    hallway, laundry
    pee here. 2 doors:
  (4)Laundry:
